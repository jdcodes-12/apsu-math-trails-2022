## **Math Trails - Moblile App**

**What is a Math Trail?**
>A **Math Trail** is a way to discover mathematics in the world around us. 
 You can explore the trail on your own, but itâ€™s fun to go with other 
 people so you can share the experience - collaborating in your exploration 
 and sharing ideas!
> 
>A Math Trail is an activity in which the participants immerse themselves in 
 the mathematics around them, taking notice of the beauty and patterns of 
 mathematics in everyday objects and occurrences. A Math Trail is a guide to 
 observe, wonder, and engage at several stops along the way.
>
>Some of the tasks on the Math Trail can be completed as you walk along the trail,
 but others you can complete once you have collected some measurements and data. 
 The tasks on the trail vary in math knowledge and ability level, but it is meant 
 to be fun and engaging! Choose the tasks that interest you most. Write things down 
 or record data on your phone. And ***Have fun!***
>
>At each stop along the way, you will be directed to notice certain items around you. 
 You may also find mathematics in things that are not mentioned in the *Trail Guide*, 
 but you are **encouraged** to record that information and **share** that with us!
>
>Once you have completed the APSU Math Trail, we encourage you to ***share the app*** or 
 your booklet and receive your pin for completion on another Clarksville Trail!
