# **Math Trails Project Notes - 2022**
> This will contain questions and considerations regarding anything project
  related (e.g. tech-stack options, planning the system, questions to ask stakeholders
  etc.). Please add to this file any thing you feel would be important to consider throughout
  the development process!

## **Cross Platform Development** 
1. **React Native**: JavaScript
   - Familiar and popular language
   - Relatively Slow (by some milliseconds)
  
1. **Flutter**: Dart (Looks similar to Python)
   - Google Owned
   - Language started from Google
   - Fast

1. **Xamarin**: C#/.Net

## **Ideal IDEs**
- Android Studio
- XCode (for IOS only) 
   - Only MACs can test for IOS

## **TODOs for Mary Dalton** 
- [Enroll to Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/)
- [Enroll to Google Play Developer](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6112435?hl=en#:~:text=During%20the%20signup%20process%2C%20you,Google%20Play%20Developer%20Distribution%20Agreement.&text=There%20is%20a%20US%2425,Visa)


## **Questions & Considerations**

### ***App Specific***
- how does the user enter measurements & data?
- should users have their own profiles?
- how do we keep track of which users have completed the math trail? And
  how do we know they recieved their pin?
- how do we add trails to the Trail Guide?
- What is the booklet?
- how often should be trails be added to the app?
- who is the target audience? 
- do you plan to be on both iOS and Android?
- how should a user be notified? In the app? Push notifications? etc.
- do you want an offline mode?

### ***Design Specific***
- do you have an idea/picture of how you want the app to look?
- do you have certain colors you want to use?
- do you have specific fonts you want to use?
- do you want animations in the app?
- should there be forms in the app to enter data?

### **Tech Specific***
- how are we going to store user data? Which DB will solve our needs?
- how much diagramming (UML, system) do we want to do before development phase?
